  We produce a model that predicts a vehicle fuel consumption from its weight, 
  with a estimated standard deviation smaller than 2 liters per 100 km. 
  The model is based on the Auto-MPG dataset.

# Introduction
**TODO**

# Model

Our model is:
$$
\mbox{fuel consumption} =  0.00899249 \times \mbox{vehicle weight} -0.90305387
$$
where the fuel consumption is measured in liters per 100 km and the vehicle 
weight in kg.

and the corresponding prediction model (line).](images/prediction.png)



# Error Distribution

Our model is practically unbiased 
$$
|\mbox{mean}| \leq 10^{-14}
$$
and its standard deviation is
$$
\mbox{std} \approx 1.815 < 2.0.
$$

# Dataset

Auto-mpg comes from @auto_mpg_9.
